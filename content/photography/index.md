Since I got my first DSLR camera towards the end of 2007, I have been in a sort of relationship with photography that has had its ups and downs. I've combined periods where I'm very excited to go out and shoot with others where I've felt quite apathetic about it. Anyway, below you can find a list of my gear and a link to a gallery with some of my photos.

## Photo gallery

From time to time I publish some of my pictures in my gallery here in this website.
