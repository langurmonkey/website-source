This site strives to be as bloat-free as possible. It does not use cookies, tracking codes, analytics scripts or anything else that can be used to invade personal privacy. 

This site serves, along with the HTML page, 1 JavaScript file, 1 font file (fork awesome) and 1 CSS file. Some special pages, like the [search page](/search), may need an additional JavaScript file download. The posts that contain mathematical formulas are less than a handful, and they get the MathJax 3 JavaScript from this very domain without requiring an external CDN.

All content is served from this domain, and is hosted on [Codeberg Pages](https://codeberg.org), a non-profit organization providing VCS and hosting services to free and open source projects. The source code of this website is available under the MIT license[^webrepo].
