This site strives to be as bloat-free as possible. It does not use cookies, tracking codes, analytics scripts or anything else that can be used to track users. 

This site serves, along with the HTML, 1 JavaScript file, 1 font file (fork awesome) and 1 CSS file. Some special pages, like the [search page](/search), may need an additional JavaScript file download. The posts that contain mathematical formulas are less than a handful, and they get the MathJax 3 JavaScript from this very domain without requiring an external CDN.

All content is served from this domain. You can check the source code in [this repository](https://gitlab.com/langurmonkey/langurmonkey.gitlab.io).
