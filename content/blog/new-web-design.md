As you may have noted, **I updated the look and feel of the website** to a more sober, greenish and polished design. The moon in the header has been replaced by a jumping monkey, which is always likeable. Regarding performance, this new site has **less and smaller CSS files** and less images and therefore it loads faster. Additionally, it uses HTML5, which is good. I also took the opportunity to update to the latest version of [drupal](https://drupal.org/) and make use of the newer [ZEN](https://drupal.org/project/ZEN) base theme. Here there's a side-by-side comparison between the old and the new styles.

More design tweaks are expected in the coming days.
