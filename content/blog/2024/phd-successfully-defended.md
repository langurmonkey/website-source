After almost 2 years since the [submission of my Ph.D. thesis](/blog/2022/thesis-submitted), I finally could defend it successfully last Friday (May 3, 2024). It has been a long journey, exactly 9 years since the initial acceptance on May 3, 2015. The road has been bumpy, especially since I had to juggle my job with the work I was doing on the side for the thesis, but in the end I think it was well worth it. I learned a ton, especially in the field of scientific visualization, which was completely new to me. I will share the author's copy of my thesis shortly.

I even got two Ph.D. hats, one from each research group (Gaia and Visual Computing) I'm part of. I accepted them with great honor and happiness.
