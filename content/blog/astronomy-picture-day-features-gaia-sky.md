Today, 26 September 2016, the Astronomy Picture of the Day ([APOD](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160926.html)) features a video we have prepared with [Gaia Sky](https://zah.uni-heidelberg.de/gaia/outreach/gaiasky/) at the [ARI/Uni Heidelberg](https://zah.uni-heidelberg.de/zah-institutes/ari/). The [video itself](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160926.html) shows a flight from outside of our Milky Way galaxy to the Sun and then a travel through the Solar System towards the vicinity of the Earth, displaying in this journey a little over 600.000 stars from the TGAS part of Gaia Data Release 1.

The video caption wanders a bit off topic, for it mentions neither [Gaia DR1](http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dr1) nor [TGAS](http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/iow_20150115), the main points of the video. Anyway, it is nice to have a video featured in APOD.
