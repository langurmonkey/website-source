The time to leave has come again. I’m leaving in three hours to Madrid, to take there an Aeroflot plane to Moscow, spending about twelve hours in the city to then take another flight to Tokyo, where Hokuto and Ikuya should be waiting for us. As I’m in a kind of hurry now, just want to say “see you later”, and remember, I’ll post the pictures of the trip as soon as I’m back in the 22nd or the 23rd.
