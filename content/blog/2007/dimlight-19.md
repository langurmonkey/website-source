At last the pictures of Japan are up and public. I know it took more than expected, but I’ve been kind of busy arranging some priority issues like the new job or our fancy super good-looking brand-new flat (yes, we finally got the long desired and proclaimed new flat in Barcelona!!). Well, lets not get off-topic… For those of you who may want to check the photos, just hit the link.

Shortly, a comprehensive travelog. Mata ne!
