Yesterday I went to a house party and after that, I met some Catalan and Spanish people and we went out downtown, around the Union Street. We actually went to a club called The Priory, in Belmont Street. This far everything looks normal. But there is a small detail you have to pay attention to. The Priory is located literally inside a church. It seems like it is a pretty spred practice in Aberdeen (dunno about the rest of Scotland) to have clubs in churches since in the same street there’s another “church club”.

Are really Scots that mad about religion that even when they’re partying they prefer to do it in a sacred place? No, I don’t think so. I think it is some kind of recycling, so that they take old-never-used buildings such as churches and turn them into another kind of more productive business. Well, anyway, in the flickr photo section I’ve uploaded some pictures so that you can take a look by yourselves.
