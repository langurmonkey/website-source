This is just a quick post to share my [.dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/langurmonkey/dotfiles) project. It contains the configuration files for most of the essential utils and tools I use in all my machines. These include the tiling window manager `i3wm`, the info bar `polybar`, the awesome `qutebrowser`, the text editor `vim` or the file manager `ranger`. Also, in the `bin/` folder there are lots of scripts (most of them hacked together quickly) to do various tasks, like converting garimin `fit` files to the open `gpx` format or to switch off the monitor in systems without a hardware switch.

The project is ever changing but it may be useful to somebody, who knows. Find it here: [.dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/langurmonkey/dotfiles).
