*This is a verbatim copy of a post made in my old blog dimlight.wrodpress.com, included here for archiving purposes*

Good morning, bon dia, bonjour, guten tag, buon giorno, goddag, hyvää päivää, konnichi wa, habari gani, buenos días, prynhawn da!

This is the first post of this modest blog and hopefully it won’t be the last ;). Gonna introduce myself. Im a common guy holding a common life in a still common country. Im engineer in informatics (or almost) by the Faculty of informatics of Barcelona -I hate informatics though- and I’m currently living in Arenys, a small, dusty and lovely town located about 40km (24.8miles) away from Barcelona City, northwards along the catalan Mediterranean coast. I spent one year in Reading, UK, studying in The University of Reading enroled in the SOCRATES/Erasmus program.

After that I had to come back to the faculty in Barcelona to finish up the few compulstory degrees left in order to finish over my degree. But I still hav to perform my final year project, and thats what allowed me to ask for another abroad experience. Finally I got it, so the January28th im moving to Aberdeen, Scotland, to do the FYP in The University of Aberdeen and, why not, hav a little fun.

So thats what this blog is mainly about. I hav in mind to do something similar to what I did with the MSN space when I was in Reading.
Thats all for the moment. I just hope you enjoy this blog and, if you like it, I encourage you to keep on coming and reading me.
Cya!
