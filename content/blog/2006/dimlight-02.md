The picture below shows a Google Earth screenshot of the Hillhead Halls zone in Aberdeen. This is where I’ll be living from the end of January on and for a little more than four months. I’ve put some numbers on it to point out some interesting findings:

![Hillhead halls of residence](/img/2006/12/hillhead.jpg)

1. These are the Hector Boece halls. One of these is supposed to be my shared flat.
2. Football pitches. As I can see from here, it seems there’s a grass turf one and an Astro turf one. Nearby there’s a patch of terrain that looks like a concrete 5-a-side football pitch. Anyway, football is near, life is good ;)
3. There’s a river right next to the halls. Dont think fishing is allowed but it is always good to hav water around.
4. Seaton park. A big extension of grass. I guess football can be played here too.
