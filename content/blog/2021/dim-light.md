The other day I was browsing through the [Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org) and I tried to look up if they had a copy of my old blog *dimlight.wordpress.com*, a blog I wrote during my second Erasmus exchange program stay in the University of Aberdeen, Scotland. Of course, they have several copies archived. The images and videos are missing, but the texts are intact, so I decided to re-publish verbatim copies of these old posts here. They were initially published between the last quarter of 2006 and October of 2007. The blog was badly written, with awkward English and weird ramblings, but hey, I wrote it, so it belongs here. All posts' titles start with the prefix "oldblog:". I added them with the original dates, so browse the bottom of the posts list to find them.
