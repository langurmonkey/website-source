A while ago [Erwan Leroy](erwanleroy.com), a VFX professional and trainer, contacted me with some questions regarding the catalogs in Gaia Sky. Basically, he was trying to decode the binary format used in Gaia Sky to load the stars using a Python script. Of course, my documentation was lacking in that very aspect, so I walked him through the format and then [improved the docs](https://gaia.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/gaiasky/docs/Data-streaming.html#particle-files).

Today, he has come back to me to share his results. Turns out he was trying to replicate an astrophoto with rotation star trails using his visual effects skills. And he came pretty damn close, I might add. I read the article and liked it, so I am sharing it here: [Rendering a plausible night sky](http://erwanleroy.com/rendering-a-plausible-night-sky-making-stars-gizmo-part-2-2/).
