I found some time to update the [Particle Physics Simulator](/project/pps) android application (version `3.7.4`) in order to fix some bugs and add a hardcoded menu button, since terminals do not have a dedicated physical button these days. Additionally, my merge request to the [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org) data repository was accepted, so now the app is also available via the F-Droid store.

Get the app from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.tss.android/) or the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tss.android).
