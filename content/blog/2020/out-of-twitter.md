It's been a while since I started trying to decouple myself from big tech companies that sell my data to third parties, give them away freely to governments, or feed them to huge, unsupervised AI systems to target me better with ads -- what is commonly known as *degoogling*. Today I'm taking another step in this process by deleting my personal Twitter account. [twitter.com/jumpinglangur](https://twitter.com/jumpinglangur) is no more!

I'll still be keeping the Gaia Sky twitter account around in order to inform part of our user base about new developments and releases related to our open source software. I see that as a necessary evil which I must endure, for now.

From now on, I'll be hanging out at [@jumpinglangur@mastodont.cat](https://mastodont.cat/jumpinglangur) only. So long, Twitter!
