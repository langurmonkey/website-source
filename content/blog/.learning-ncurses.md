Lately, I have been kicking the dust off my C++ skills, and decided to start by learning to use a library which I have been eyeing for a while, `ncurses`. `ncurses` is a C library which lets you create terminal applications in the fashion of the featured gif of this post. Basically, you can use the terminal to implement text-based user interfaces.

The project I'm sharing today is [`tsnake`](https://gitlab.com/langurmonkey/tsnake), a terminal-based snake game with map support.
