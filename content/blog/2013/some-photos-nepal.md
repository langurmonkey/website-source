Today I'd like to drop some photos of my recent holidays to Nepal here. All of these were taken using a Canon `40D` with the `Canon 28-105 USM II f3.5-4.5`. I decided to leave my other two lenses home (the wide angle lens `Sigma 10-20 1:4-5.6 EX DC HSM` and the standard `Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 Mk II`) because of the philosophy of the travel. We were mostly a backpacker group and we'd be moving around quite a lot, trekking the Himalayas and going to the jungle, so I figured the extra weight wasn't worth it. Looking backwards, I regret not taking the wide angle lens, for some of the landscapes we could behold were truly amazing.

Also, I took a good bunch of pictures using my phone, the `LG Nexus 4`, you'll find some in the Flickr set too.
