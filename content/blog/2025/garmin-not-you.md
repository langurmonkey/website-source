I've been a Garmin user for many years, shelling out non-trivial amounts of monies for their sports watches. My first Garmin watch was a [Forerunner 10](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/107143/pn/010-01039-00) (black/red). Battery life was abysmal, but back then this was the norm. Today, I'm sporting a [Forerunner 255](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/780139), which I love. It's not top-of-the-line, but it is more than enough for my modest purposes. These devices have been my trusty companions on countless runs, football matches, and hikes, providing invaluable data without any hidden costs. But now, Garmin has decided to introduce Garmin Connect+, a subscription service priced at €8.99 per month or €89.99 annually. Really, Garmin?​

This past Thursday, March 27th, Garmin announced a premium plan called **Garmin Connect+** in a press release titled ["Elevate your health and fitness goals with Garmin Connect+"](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/newsroom/press-release/wearables-health/elevate-your-health-and-fitness-goals-with-garmin-connect/). This new service promises AI-powered insights through their "Active Intelligence" feature, offering personalized suggestions based on health and activity data. Additionally, it includes a performance dashboard with custom charts, enhanced LiveTrack features, and exclusive app badges. I don't care for any of that, but these additions may sound appealing to some. I can't help but feel a sense of *déjà vu*. Initially, companies introduce new features behind a paywall, assuring users that existing functionalities remain free. But as revenue targets loom, there's a creeping tendency to lock previously free features behind that same paywall, degrading the user experience. This gradual decline, often referred to as *enshittification*, has plagued many platforms.

Garmin's move mirrors trends seen with other fitness platforms like Strava, which have also introduced subscription models for premium features. While it's understandable that publicly traded companies seek additional revenue streams, it's disheartening when it comes at the expense of loyal users who have already invested heavily in their products. The general feeling of their customers is clear. You just need to look around the [Garmin subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/garmin), or the [Garmin Subscription Model megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/1jl9mef/garmin_subscription_model_megathread/) specifically, to know what I'm talking about.

Of course, as these things usually go, Garmin assures us that all existing features will remain free and that Connect+ merely adds new functionalities. I don't buy it. Forgive me for being skeptical. We've seen this play out before, and it often doesn't end well for the consumer.​

Garmin watches are already a significant investment. Introducing a subscription model feels like a cash grab, especially when the features offered seem like they could be standard inclusions. It's a slippery slope, and I fear we're at the top, ready to slide down. I hope Garmin proves me wrong and maintains the integrity of its free offerings. But history suggests otherwise, and I can't help but brace for the inevitable *enshittification* of a platform I once held in high regard.

One thing is clear to me. My next sports watch will not be a Garmin watch. This move has annihilated my trust in the company. I've started researching other options, and I have found [Polar](https://polar.com) and [Suunto](https://suunto.com), both based in Europe, to be excellent alternatives.
