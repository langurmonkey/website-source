New friction feature has been added to the **Particle Physics Simulator v3.3** for Android.
Now, particles can be set to have friction so that their **velocity will decrease over time** at a steady rate. You can make them behave like snooker balls! Also, this version tunes particle tail lengths and adds some interesting performance tweaks that should make it run smoother in handicapped devices.
