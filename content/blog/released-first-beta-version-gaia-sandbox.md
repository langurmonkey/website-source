Today we have published the first public BETA version (**v0.703b**) of the [Gaia Sandbox](http://www.zah.uni-heidelberg.de/gaia/outreach/gaiasky/), a real-time, 3D, astronomy visualisation application that runs on **Linux**, **Windows** and **MacOSX** systems. Its main purpose is to serve as an outreach platform to [ESA](http://sci.esa.int/)'s [Gaia](http://sci.esa.int/gaia/) mission, and it is free (as in freedom and gratis). It is also open source under the LGPL, so go [try it out](http://www.zah.uni-heidelberg.de/gaia/outreach/gaiasky/)!


The Gaia Sandbox is a real time simulation of [Gaia](http://sci.esa.int/gaia/), the Solar System and the Galaxy with advanced graphics and more than 100.000 stars to observe and navigate through. Here are some of its main features:

-  Real time 3D simulation of the Solar System and the Galaxy.
-  Intuitive controls to steer the camera with ease.
-  Real **Gaia orbit** and attitude.
-  Real time Gaia Field of View projections.
-  Real time Gaia observation computation.
-  **Scriptable** with python.
-  Output each frame as an image with any resolution to compose videos.
-  Postprocessing effects: Lens flare, bloom.
-  **Atmospheric scattering** model.
-  Dynamic **hi-res texturing**.
-  Per-pixel lighting.
-  **Realistic time** simulation.
-  Works on Windows, Linux and MacOSX.
