In this post I'm documenting the software setup I use in my machines. This has been converging for a long time and I don't consider it final, obviously. However, right now, it works well for me.

I use this configuration in the following machines:

**ARI desktop** - *hidalgo*, i7-7700, 16 Gb RAM, GTX 1070, Ubuntu 18.04
**IWR desktop** - *herschel*, i7-4790K, 16 Gb RAM, GTX 970, Manjaro Linux
**Home laptop** - *simian*, Dell XPS 13 9370 13", i7-8550U, 16 Gb RAM, Intel UHD 620, Arch Linux
**Home desktop** - *bonobo*, i5-4460, 16 Gb RAM, GTX 970, Antergos Linux

## Dotfiles project

All of the configuration files are hosted in my dotfiles repository. Have a look. To bootstrap and deploy, see next section.

## Bootstrapping and deploying

I have a couple of scripts to painlessly and automatically bootstrap and deploy the configuration. Please, see the [README](https://gitlab.com/langurmonkey/dotfiles/blob/master/README.md) file for more details.
Basically, run

```
 $  bash <(curl -s https://gitlab.com/langurmonkey/dotfiles/raw/master/bootstrap.sh)
```

To check out the repository to `~/.dotfiles` and install the required software. Then, do

```
~/.dotfiles/deploy
```

To deploy the configuration. You are done.


## Window manager

I use `i3wm` in every computer I have to do work with. Additionally, Gnome Shell is installed to my home desktop *bonobo* for convenience, since it is connected to the TV in my living room.

## RAW photo editing

I've been mostly using [RawTherapee](https://rawtherapee.com) (please, disregard the name) for years, but lately I've been playing around more and more with [darktable](https://www.darktable.org). Both have their strong points. I think I prefer RawTherapee's user interface, but darktable has more options and is better at memory management. One of the killer features that might end up tipping the balance for me in darktable's favour is the GPU acceleration support via OpenCL which makes editing operations lightning fast. Also, darktable supports masks, which RawTherapee does not.

At the end of the day, both are very capable and produce good results. Also, both support `.CR2` and `.RW2` from my Canon 40D and my Panasonic Lumix LX10/15 respectively.

## Scripting

bash, python
