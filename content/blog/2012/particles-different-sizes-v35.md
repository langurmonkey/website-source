I just published the **latest version (3.5)** of the Particle Physics Simulator, with a fancy new feature that allows for **different-sized particles** to be shot into the simulation. You'll notice a frame with a size-changing particle when you hold your touch down for a shoot. The size of that particle at the moment you take the shot is the size of the particle being created. Easy, ain't it?

Additionally, there are a number of **other improvements and bug fixes**, go [discover](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tss.android) them yourself!
