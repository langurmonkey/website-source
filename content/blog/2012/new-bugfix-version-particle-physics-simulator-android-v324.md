We just released the new **bugfix version (3.2.4)** which fixes the following bugs (all of them reported by Keith):

-  Repel touches were off in big simulation area mode.
-  Zooming multitouch acted as a single touch when first finger was lifted.
-  Particles got stuck on wall ends.
-  Additionally, the maximum number of walls has been increased from ten to fifteen.
