Hi there! I have been messing around with a snake game written in `HTML5`+`js`. A great deal of parameters can be modified in real time using an input form in the same page, such as the width and length of canvas, cell shape, background colour, food colour, snake colour and the speed of the game. Also, I posted the full *javascript* code.

If you are interested, you can check the results [**here**](/projects/snake).
