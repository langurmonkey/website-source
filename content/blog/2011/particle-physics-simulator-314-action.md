I just made a new video of the newest version of Particle Physics Simulator (`3.1.4`) in action running on my Motorola Milestone. The phone is kind of old for today's standards (`600 MHz Cortex-A8` CPU,
`PowerVR SGX530` GPU, 256MB RAM)  but the frame rate is stable at about 30 FPS regardless of the number of particles. I'd say the performance is fine for the first time since the migration to OpenGL ES in v2.0.

Enjoy it!
