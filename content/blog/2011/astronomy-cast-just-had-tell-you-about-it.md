Today I want to talk a bit about an initiative that I've been following for quite a long time now and I think deserves some attention. I'm talking about [**Astronomy Cast**](astronomycast.com). Astronomy Cast, in their own words, takes a **fact-based journey through the cosmos** as it offers listeners weekly discussions on astronomical topics ranging from planets to cosmology. Fraser Cane and Dr. Pamela Gay elaborate a high-quality podcast each week, where they discuss several astronomy, astrophysics, cosmology and particle physics topics. The span of their talks is just astounding, and they really have a gift for explaining complicated concepts in a very straightforward manner.

Special and general relativity, the history of astronomy, black holes, sun spots, gamma-ray bursts, telescope types, space missions, quasars, quantum mechanics, the search for a theory of everything or the age of the Universe are just a tiny sample of what you can expect from their enjoyable talks.

If you are interested in astrophysics, physics and science in general, or you are just curious and want to know more about the Universe we live in, add the Astronomy Cast feed to your podcast client of choice right now.
