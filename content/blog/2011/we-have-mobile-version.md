*03/2019 - This post is long outdated, as the design I've been using for years is responsive and there's no need anymore for mobile-specific verisons*

Finally the **mobile version** of this site is up and ready to go. It features most of the characteristics of the full site and also most of the functionality. Hope you find it useful when browsing from your handheld devices. Controls to switch forth and back between versions are provided. If you want, give it a try:

-  [Mobile version](http://tonisagrista.com/?device=mobile)
-  [Desktop version](http://tonisagrista.com/?device=desktop)
