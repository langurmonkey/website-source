I just submitted a **new version (v2.5.5) of the Particle Physics Simulator** to the Android Market, so you should be receiving it shortly in your devices. This is a bugfix version:

-  **Fixed bug** that prevented simulations in merger collisions mode from working properly. Thanks to Neil for reporting.
-  Some minor **performance improvements** have been added that should make the simulator run more smoothly.
