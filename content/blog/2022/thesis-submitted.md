After some seven long years of working on my Ph.D. off-the-clock and three extensions, about a month ago I finally submitted my thesis to the doctoral office for review. I started back in 2015 when I had no kids. Today, I have two kids and 3 peer-reviewed papers on top visualization journals (and an unpublished one). 

It has been an interesting ride indeed. For now, I can relax for a few weeks until the examination date is set.
