The **N-Body Live Wallpaper** is an application for [Android](www.android.com) (v2.1+) powered devices that enables the user to have a particle zoo of gravity interactions as a home screen wallpaper. The application is heavily based on the first version fo the [Particle Physics Simulator](/projects/pps), but adapted to suit a live wallaper needs. Features:

*   Real n-body simulation, pure gravitational interactions between particles.
*   Allow or not physically realistic collisions and mergers between particles.
*   Set particle and background colors.
*   Set gravity strength and particle mass.
*   Accelerometer support.
*   Shoot particles or create repulsive forces using touchscreen.
*   Enable the action to expand beyond your screen limits without losing particles.
*   Enable or disable the central black hole which exerts a neat attractive force towards the center.
*   Enable or disable particle trails (disable to improve performance).

Take into account we're talking about a real n-body simulation. I recommend keeping the number of particles reasonably low for the live wallpaper version (about 10-20), even though it only executes when the screen is on. Does not drain your battery keeping loops or listeners when sleeping. Give it a try, download it from the [Google Play](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.tss.nbody.livewallpaper). If you like it very much you can even [buy me a beer](/donate)!
