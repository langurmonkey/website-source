##### **v3.8.2** (06/10/2025)
- Add margins to bottom buttons, zoom-pan layout, velocity slider, and FPS counter. This prevents the UI from being obfuscated by the navigation bar in some devices.

##### **v3.8.1** (02/10/2025)
- Update target SDK to 36
- Upgrade to Gradle 8.13
- Fix issues with build

##### **v3.7.4** (23/04/2020)
- Fix double launcher issue
- Rename app to "ParticleSim"
- Fix build targetSdk issues

##### **v3.7.3** (21/04/2020)
- Increase max number of walls from 16 to 5
- Increase max number of sparks from 20 to 40
- Increase max number of bodies from 200 to 800

##### **v3.7.2** (21/04/2020)
- Fix orientation policy

##### **v3.7.1** (20/04/2020)
- Fix layout issues
- Update button background

##### **v3.7** (20/04/2020)
- Add button to open legacy menu to main screen 
- 64-bit support

##### **v3.6** (02/01/2013)
- Tail gradient effect (performance is affected, but it's cool!).
- Different star images.
- Bugfixes.

##### **v3.5.1** (31/12/2012)
- Fix for newer devices with no menu button. Now the menu button should appear as three dots at the bottom-   right of the screen.
- Fix clipping problem with some sprites.
- BH picker improved.
- Friction and gravity strength values tweaked.

##### **v3.5** (24/12/2012)
- Different-   size particles.
- Other minor issues and bug fixes.

##### **v3.4** (08/07/2012)
- Load and save simulations to XML files.

##### **v3.3.1** (14/05/2012)
- Fixed crash in prefs screen.
- Added extra friction mode.
- Small performance tweak.
- Copy protection removed.

##### **v3.3** (05/05/2012)
- Friction! Particles can be set now to have friction so they will eventually stop.
- Tails do not show for particles in rest.
- Performance tweaks.

##### **v3.2.4** (01/05/2012)
- Bugfix version (thanks Keith for reporting).
- Repel touches off in big simu area fixed.
- Multitouch behaviour fixed.
- Particles do not get stuck in wall ends anymore.
- Number of walls increased from 10 to 15.

##### **v3.2.3** (04/04/2012)
- Velocity bar offset.

##### **v3.2.2** (04/04/2012)
- Fixed bug with static particles and elastic collisions.

##### **v3.2.1** (03/04/2012)
- Spelling mistake corrected (thanks Connor for reporting).

##### **v3.2** (03/04/2012)
- Added option to change the tail length (short, medium, long).
- Gravity force can now be set to zero (no gravity).
- Simulation can be paused using top velocity bar.
- Initial particle size can be modified (extra small, small, medium, large, extra large).
- Static particles can now be created using the shooting button.

##### **v3.1.5** (31/12/2011)
- Added accelerometer support, lost in v3.1.3.

##### **v3.1.4** (20/12/2011)
- The app can now be moved to SD card.

##### **v3.1.3** (28/11/2011)
- Accelerometer, FPS and particle tail controls are now on-   screen for direct operation.
- Moved controls used in big area mode to the left of the screen.
- Performance tweaks.

##### **v3.1.2** (24/11/2011)
- Pan and Center camera buttons not available when in 'screen simulation area' mode.
- Number of particles can be now set to 0, and black hole is not counted as a particle.
- Antiparticle control has been disabled in Particle-   Mesh mode, for in this mode the interactions are not between particles.
- Bug fixes.

##### **v3.1.1** (23/11/2011)
- Possibility to display mesh points in simulation in PM mode.
- Mesh density can now be changed. Set a higher value to increase accuracy (has an impact on performance).

##### **v3.1** (22/11/2011)
- About page redesigned.
- Simulation only restarted when needed (if prefs were changed).

##### **v3.0** (07/10/2011)
- Particle-   Mesh force calculator method. This method does not include particle-   to-   particle interactions and uses a mesh to calculate densities used later to calculate forces on particles. It runs faster than the Particle-   Particle (direct) method.
- Display grid densities as background in the Particle-   Mesh mode. It creates a beautiful effect.
- Preferences have been rearranged.

##### **v2.6** (05/10/2011)
- Background images. Select an image from your gallery to set it as background image in the simulation. If you do so, background colour setting is overriden. To get back to a plain color, just select the background colour option you desire.

##### **v2.5.5** (22/09/2011)
- Fixed bug that prevented simulation to run properly in merger collisions mode (thanks to Neil for reporting).
- Some minor performance improvements.

##### **v2.5.4** (19/09/2011)
- Fixed bugs that force closed the app since last performance update.

##### **v2.5.2** (17/09/2011)
- Performance improved, should run better now, specially on slower devices.
- Name changed.

##### **v2.5.1**
- Orientation set to portrait.

##### **v2.5**
- Repulsive particles! Two kinds of particles that are repulsive to each other can be added. Just click the particle shooter twice to add 'anti particles'.
- Info screen now has a wee user guide.

##### **v2.4.3**
- Fixed bug where collision effects seemed to emerge from black hole (thanks to Nick for reporting).

##### **v2.4.2**
- Elastic collisions.
