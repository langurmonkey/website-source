-   Load and save simulations to XML files.

##### **v3.3.1** (14/05/2012)
-   Fixed crash in prefs screen.
-   Added extra friction mode.
-   Small performance tweak.
-   Copy protection removed.

##### **v3.3** (05/05/2012)
-   Friction! Particles can be set now to have friction so they will eventually stop.
-   Tails do not show for particles in rest.
-   Performance tweaks.

##### **v3.2.4** (01/05/2012)
-   Bugfix version (thanks Keith for reporting).
-   Repel touches off in big simu area fixed.
-   Multitouch behaviour fixed.
-   Particles do not get stuck in wall ends anymore.
-   Number of walls increased from 10 to 15.

##### **v3.2.3** (04/04/2012)
-    Velocity bar offset.

##### **v3.2.2** (04/04/2012)
-   Fixed bug with static particles and elastic collisions.

##### **v3.2.1** (03/04/2012)
-   Spelling mistake corrected (thanks Connor for reporting).

##### **v3.2** (03/04/2012)
-   Added option to change the tail length (short, medium, long).
-   Gravity force can now be set to zero (no gravity).
-   Simulation can be paused using top velocity bar.
-   Initial particle size can be modified (extra small, small, medium, large, extra large).
-   Static particles can now be created using the shooting button.

##### **v3.1.5** (31/12/2011)
-   Added accelerometer support, lost in v3.1.3.

##### **v3.1.4** (20/12/2011)
-   The app can now be moved to SD card.

##### **v3.1.3** (28/11/2011)
-   Accelerometer, FPS and particle tail controls are now on-   screen for direct operation.
-   Moved controls used in big area mode to the left of the screen.
-   Performance tweaks.

##### **v3.1.2** (24/11/2011)
-   Pan and Center camera buttons not available when in 'screen simulation area' mode.
-   Number of particles can be now set to 0, and black hole is not counted as a particle.
-   Antiparticle control has been disabled in Particle-   Mesh mode, for in this mode the interactions are not between particles.
-   Bug fixes.

##### **v3.1.1** (23/11/2011)
-   Possibility to display mesh points in simulation in PM mode.
-   Mesh density can now be changed. Set a higher value to increase accuracy (has an impact on performance).

##### **v3.1** (22/11/2011)
-   About page redesigned.
-   Simulation only restarted when needed (if prefs were changed).

##### **v3.0** (07/10/2011)
-   Particle-   Mesh force calculator method. This method does not include particle-   to-   particle interactions and uses a mesh to calculate densities used later to calculate forces on particles. It runs faster than the Particle-   Particle (direct) method.
-   Display grid densities as background in the Particle-   Mesh mode. It creates a beautiful effect.
-   Preferences have been rearranged.

##### **v2.6** (05/10/2011)
-   Background images. Select an image from your gallery to set it as background image in the simulation. If you do so, background colour setting is overriden. To get back to a plain color, just select the background colour option you desire.

##### **v2.5.5** (22/09/2011)
-   Fixed bug that prevented simulation to run properly in merger collisions mode (thanks to Neil for reporting).
-   Some minor performance improvements.

##### **v2.5.4** (19/09/2011)
-   Fixed bugs that force closed the app since last performance update.

##### **v2.5.2** (17/09/2011)
-   Performance improved, should run better now, specially on slower devices.
-   Name changed.

##### **v2.5.1**
-   Orientation set to portrait.

##### **v2.5**
-   Repulsive particles! Two kinds of particles that are repulsive to each other can be added. Just click the particle shooter twice to add 'anti particles'.
-   Info screen now has a wee user guide.

##### **v2.4.3**
-   Fixed bug where collision effects seemed to emerge from black hole (thanks to Nick for reporting).

##### **v2.4.2**
-   Elastic collisions.
