How the hell did you end up here?

Anyway, my name is **Toni Sagristà Sellés** and I am a computer scientist and M.Sc. in Astrophysics and Cosmology. I like computer graphics and visualization, astronomy, photography (sometimes), snowboarding, playing and watching football, drawing horribly, playing with my kids, and occasionally gaming. I sometimes use the aliases `jumpinglangur` and `langurmonkey`.

I'm currently working in the Gaia[^gaia] group of the Astronomisches Rechen-Institut[^ari] in Heidelberg, and doing research in scientific visualization in the Visual Computing Group[^viscomp] of the Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing[^iwr], also in Heidelberg.

- explore my [publications](/papers)
- chillax watching [some of my photos](/photo-gallery)
- have a look at my [CV](/resume), just in case you want to offer me my dream job
- find me on [mastodon](https://mastodont.cat/@jumpinglangur) and (on a professional capacity) on [twitter](https://twitter.com/GaiaSky_dev)
