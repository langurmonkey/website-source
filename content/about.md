How the hell did you end up here?

Anyway, my name is **Toni Sagristà Sellés** and I am a computer scientist and M.Sc. in Astrophysics and Cosmology. I like computer graphics and visualization, astronomy, photography (sometimes), snowboarding, playing and watching football, drawing horribly, playing with my kids, and occasionally gaming. I sometimes use the aliases `jumpinglangur` and `langurmonkey`.

I'm currently working in the [Gaia](https://sci.esa.int/web/gaia) group of the [Astronomisches Rechen-Institut](https://ari.uni-heidelberg.de) and doing research in scientific visualization in the [visual computing group](https://vcg.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de) of the [Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing](https://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de).

While you are here, you may want to:

- check out some of my [current and past projects](/projects)
- explore my [publications](/papers)
- chillax watching [some of my photos](/photo-gallery)
- have a look at my [CV](/resume), just in case you want to offer me my dream job
- find me on [mastodon](https://mastodont.cat/@jumpinglangur) and (on a professional capacity) on [twitter](https://twitter.com/GaiaSky_dev)
